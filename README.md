# How to use
1. Download Xaymar's StreamFX OBS plugin;
2. Use StreamFX to apply these shaders as a filter inside OBS;

## Shaders currently included:

 - vMix Style Cropping/Masking shader w/ feathering and optional auto-centering:
	 - allows you to crop a source using X-left / X-right / Y-top / Y-bottom controls (in my opinion, this is way better than the native Crop/Pad filter);
	 - you also have the option to enable auto-centering for the resulting cropped image;
